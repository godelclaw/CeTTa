# Native byte stores

`store` is a SQLite-free, persistent byte-key interface. Applications define
records, key layouts, indexes, queries, constraints and receipts in MeTTa.
The native owner validates snapshots and publishes one immutable root for a
whole batch, using the same CSL1 journal framing and checkpoint publication
as the space service. This is not an SQL interface.

The named-space and older durable-runtime interfaces have not yet migrated to
this owner. The byte-store library is available for qualification; adding it
does not migrate an application's existing database.

## Owners and snapshots

Import `(library store)` in PeTTa, or `store` in HE and Prime.

- `(store:open path "create")` initializes a missing store, or opens an existing
  one. `"existing"` never initializes a store. Both return `(StoreOpened owner)`.
- The directory must already exist durably, including its parent entry. It must
  belong to the process user and have no group or other permission bits. The
  owner does not create parent directories. It refuses an empty or damaged
  published manifest instead of silently creating new state.
- `(store:snapshot owner)` returns `(StoreSnapshot view epoch revision)`.
  It confirms the durability of a first-seen root before returning it.
- `(store:close resource)` returns `StoreClosed`. Owners, snapshots, body readers
  and scans are independent resources. A reader can outlive its snapshot, and a
  snapshot can outlive its owner. Explicit close and request-arena retirement
  both release resources.

Handles carry native ownership. Their printed identifiers cannot be replayed
as capabilities, sent through the portable value protocol, or saved as durable
application identities. Keep handles within a call; reopen by store path for a
later call. Use a separate owner handle for each concurrent caller.

## Atomic writes and observations

`(store:commit owner view (ops ...))` validates the captured epoch, store domain
and logical revision. Operations are `(put key bytes)` and `(remove key)`.
Accepted batches return a new `StoreSnapshot`; accepted no-ops also advance
the logical revision. Compaction changes the physical generation without
changing that revision.

`(store:commit-scoped owner view (reads ...) (writes ...) (ops ...))` validates
complete declared views instead of the whole-store revision. Scopes are:

- `(point key)` for one exact key, including its absence;
- `(range lower upper)` for a lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive byte range;
- `(prefix bytes)` for all keys beginning with those bytes.

The symbol `NoBound` removes a range bound; the string `"NoBound"` is a real
byte key. Every written key must belong to a declared write scope. Read and
write scopes both participate in validation. Keys and body bytes are compared
exactly, including missing keys; an index projection or a body hash alone is
not a validation certificate. Callers must declare every influencing read,
including negative and capacity dependencies. Unrelated scopes do not conflict.

One root publishes all operations. A snapshot is a repeatable read view, not
a one-use protocol authority. Applications must commit durable idempotency
receipts together with their changes; a bounded reply cache is insufficient.

## Reads without materializing the archive

- `(store:get view key maximum-bytes)` returns `(StoreValue bytes)`, `StoreAbsent`
  or `(StoreTooLarge length)`. The maximum is a caller-selected materialization
  allowance, not a limit on which stored values remain retrievable.
- `(store:blob-open view key)` returns `(StoreBlob reader length)`. The reader
  verifies its immutable body once. `(store:blob-read reader offset count)`
  returns `(StoreBytes bytes next-offset)` and supports repeatable offsets.
- `(store:scan-open view lower upper)` returns `(StoreScan scan)`.
  `(store:scan-next scan position)` starts at position zero and returns
  `(StoreKey key body-length next-position)` or `StoreEnd`. Repeating the last
  position repeats its answer; skipping positions is refused. Keys arrive in
  ascending byte order from the captured revision. Fetch bodies separately.
- `(store:key-i64 integer)` returns `(StoreKeyBytes bytes)`, a fixed-width signed
  integer order embedding. Applications decide where to use it in their keys.

The immutable disk index keeps payloads separate from searchable nodes. Reads,
scope comparisons and compaction use bounded scratch space rather than loading
the corpus. Per-item format bounds remain explicit in the C API.

`store:encode` and `store:decode` are convenience adapters for the existing CAV1
portable value format. They preserve value kinds and return inert data. Its
portable-wire bounds still apply; a refused record is never truncated. Raw
byte bodies and chunk readers support larger payloads. A chunked record codec
is still needed before migrating a domain with individual records exceeding
the convenience codec's bounds.

## Failure and maintenance

`(StoreRefused reason)` distinguishes conflict, busy, invalid input, corruption,
version, resource capacity and I/O failures. `(StoreUncertain)` means publication
may have happened. It must not be interpreted as rollback or permission to
repeat an external effect.

An ambiguous native publication blocks further writes on that owner until
`(store:recover owner)` verifies and synchronizes the visible root. Recovery
returns a snapshot. The application then checks its own receipt and identity
to decide whether another local write is needed. Recovery never sends HTTP or
replays another external operation. A failure to allocate a returned view after
successful publication is also reported as uncertain to the caller.

`(store:compact owner)` builds a new segment outside the writer lock and
publishes it only if the source root is still current. A changed root refuses
that maintenance attempt. `(store:collect owner)` first confirms the visible
root durably, then removes obsolete segment names. Live builders hold kernel
locks and old readers retain open descriptors, so collection cannot revoke
either. The owner lock is nonblocking and covers validation/publication, not
model calls or application planning.

## Qualification

`make test-store-library` checks native publication faults, concurrent writers,
scope validation, disk-index behavior, import-bit separation, and the actual
MeTTa interface against an offline SQLite byte-map oracle.
`make test-store-lifetime` measures repeated explicit and automatic resource
release through the value worker.

`tests/check_store_publication.py` compares native fault traces with
MeTTapedia's checked `Mettapedia.Machines.NativeStorePublication` model. This
is finite conformance evidence. The Lean model states its filesystem
assumptions; neither it nor the tests prove the C implementation or fsync.
